# Introduction

Dream Home is a real estate web site for people who can choose their suitable or dream place to live.
<br><br>
Dream Home Provides complete information about Property. Some website falls short on providing a complete picture of a neighbourhood or nearby things. In our project we add feature called nearby which has information about schools, hospitals, local amenities nearby property which you are looking. we're going to provide a one-stop-shop for all things "where to live".

# Need for this Project

1. **Property Information**
<ul>
  <li>People who need to find a place to live or do business don't necessarily have to go there       in person to receive the information.</li>
  <li>On a single website, they may find all the information about neighbourhoods.</li>
</ul>    

2. **Time saving**
<ul>
  <li>It requires a lot of work to research various areas before choosing the finest one.</li>
  <li>By filtering some area or budget they can save time to choose best place.</li>
</ul> 

3. **Budget friendly**
<ul>
  <li>To receive the information you need to find a place that fits your budget, you will need a broker. The cost is raised by this third party's involvement.</li>
  <li>However, with the use of this website, a user can purchase a home without the assistance of a broker, making it more affordable.</li>
</ul> 

4. **Convenience**
<ul>
  <li>This website will be accessible round-the-clock and from anywhere, making it easier for users to look for their dream home at any time or location.</li>
</ul>
