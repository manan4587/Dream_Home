## Overview

In the DreamHome Real Estate Website project, we use an activity diagram to visualize and describe the sequence of actions, decisions, and interactions within the system. This diagram helps users and developers understand how different components of our real estate platform work together to achieve specific tasks.

## Purpose

The purpose of the activity diagram is to:

- Provide an at-a-glance overview of the system's workflow.
- Illustrate the steps involved in various user interactions and processes.
- Clarify decision points and branching logic within the system.
- Serve as a reference for developers, testers, and other stakeholders.
